// Maximum Subarray Sum: Given an array of integers, 
// find the maximum possible sum of a subarray within the array.

function maxSubarraySum(nums) {
  let currentMax = nums[0];
  let globalMax = nums[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax + nums[i]);
    globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, currentMax);
  }

  return globalMax;
}


/*  
You can call the maxSubarraySum function by passing your array of integers as an argument. 
It will return the maximum subarray sum.

The logic of the solution remains the same as the Python implementation. 
The function initializes currentMax and globalMax with the first element of the array and 
then iterates over the remaining elements, updating the values accordingly. 
Finally, it returns the globalMax, which represents the maximum subarray sum.

This JavaScript solution has a time complexity of O(n), 
where n is the size of the input array, 
making it an efficient solution for finding the maximum subarray sum.


I apologize for the confusion caused by the incorrect explanation. Let's go through the example again with the correct step-by-step process:

Consider the input array: `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`

1. Initialize `currentMax` and `globalMax` with the first element of the array: `currentMax = -2` and `globalMax = -2`.

2. Iterating over the array starting from the second element:
   - For `nums[1] = 1`, compare it with the sum of the current element and `currentMax`: `1 > -2 + 1`. Since `1` is greater, update `currentMax` to `1`.
   - Update `globalMax` to the larger value between the current `globalMax` (-2) and the updated `currentMax` (1), which is `globalMax = 1`.

3. For `nums[2] = -3`, compare it with the sum of the current element and `currentMax`: `-3 > -2 + (-3)`. Since `-3` is greater, update `currentMax` to `-3`.
   - Update `globalMax` remains unchanged at `1`.

4. For `nums[3] = 4`, compare it with the sum of the current element and `currentMax`: `4 > -3 + 4`. Since `4` is greater, update `currentMax` to `4`.
   - Update `globalMax` to the larger value between the current `globalMax` (1) and the updated `currentMax` (4), which is `globalMax = 4`.

5. For `nums[4] = -1`, compare it with the sum of the current element and `currentMax`: `-1 > 4 + (-1)`. Since `-1` is not greater, keep `currentMax` unchanged at `4`.
   - `globalMax` remains unchanged at `4`.

6. For `nums[5] = 2`, compare it with the sum of the current element and `currentMax`: `2 > 4 + 2`. Since `2` is greater, update `currentMax` to `2`.
   - Update `globalMax` to the larger value between the current `globalMax` (4) and the updated `currentMax` (2), which is `globalMax = 4`.

7. For `nums[6] = 1`, compare it with the sum of the current element and `currentMax`: `1 > 2 + 1`. Since `1` is greater, update `currentMax` to `1`.
   - `globalMax` remains unchanged at `4`.

8. For `nums[7] = -5`, compare it with the sum of the current element and `currentMax`: `-5 > 1 + (-5)`. Since `-5` is greater, update `currentMax` to `-5`.
   - Update `globalMax` to the larger value between the current `globalMax` (4) and the updated `currentMax` (-5), which is `globalMax = 4`.

9. For `nums[8] = 4`, compare it with the sum of the current element and `currentMax`: `4 > -5 + 4`. Since `4` is greater, update `currentMax` to `4`.
   - Update `globalMax` to the larger value between the current `globalMax` (4) and the updated `currentMax` (4), which is `globalMax = 4`.

10. After iterating through the entire array,

 the final value of `globalMax` is `4`, which represents the maximum subarray sum.

I apologize once again for the incorrect explanation earlier. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate your understanding.
